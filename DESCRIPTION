Description: Estimate coverage bias in samples from RNA-Seq experiments and test for differential spliced transcripts from two groups of RNA-Seq samples using a hierarchical multinomial logistic regression model. Each trainscript is assigned to a p-value to indicate whether it is differentially spliced or not.
